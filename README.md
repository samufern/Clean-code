# Clean Code

This repository showcases a project developed with an emphasis on clean code principles. It provides a set of guidelines and practical implementations to help developers write readable, maintainable, and efficient code.

## Overview

The project adheres to strict coding standards as detailed in the accompanying documentation (*Normativa_de_codigo.pdf*). It includes a main application along with supporting modules and example projects that illustrate the application of clean code practices.

## Features

- **Clean Code Guidelines:** Comprehensive coding standards to ensure consistency and clarity.
- **Well-Structured Project:** Organized into meaningful directories and modules for easy navigation.
- **Practical Implementation:** Includes a main Python application (`Main.py`) and supporting components.
- **Testing and Documentation:** Provides sample test files and a requirements file for environment setup.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- All required Python packages are listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samufern/Clean-code.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Clean-code
   ```
3. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main application by executing:
```bash
python Main.py
```
This will launch the application and demonstrate the implementation of clean coding practices.
